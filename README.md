# Breast Cancer Data Analysis

This project analyzes the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-Learn and builds a predictive model to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign based on cell nuclei features.

## Dataset

The Breast Cancer dataset is a built-in dataset from Scikit-Learn. It includes data derived from digitized images of cell nuclei, consisting of:

- **Features**: 30 attributes, including mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness.
- **Labels**: Two target classes â€“ Malignant (1) and Benign (0).

## Requirements:

Python 3.x
Jupiter Notebook or google Colab
Breast cancer dataset from Scikit-Learn library

## The models implemented:

1.Logistic Regression
2.Decision Tree Classifier
3.Random Forest Classifier
4.Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5.K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

## Evaluation:

The evaluation has been done on the basis of its accuracy,precision,recall and f1 score of each model.

Finally,the results are copmared each other and find the best model which gives the best accuracy.Also,find the model which perform the worst according to the accuracy it gives.
